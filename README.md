Mock Test App Script Projects 

#First process of Conducting a Mock Test would be preparation of paper and their collection from teachers
In order for the preparation to go seamlessly standalome app script was written in a google drive folder names Mocks 2024. 
A sheet with three columns Teachers Name, Subjects they Teach, and a concatenate of first two columns was used
along with a sheet for cover page that they wil merge later to the question paper. 
To eliminate the process of creating multiple folders, renaming them, and copying the cover page to each this script was written
